Mak's Language Requirements
===================
* Must be Procedural Language
* Either existing language and/or subset OR invent a new one
* End of Semester must implement enough of lang to execute *nontrivial* program

### Suggested Implementatation of grammar and compiler
1. Expressions w/ numeric constants and scalar variables
2. Assignment statements
3. Control statements
4. Variable declarations (no type defs yet)
5. Procedure and function declarations
6. Procedure and function calls
7. Type definitions

## Assign #6
We need to implement the first three items on the list above. Secondly, it must print out informative messages about language constructs, but it does not need to fancy, just readable.

## Python Compiler
I found the offical link to the language specs:
