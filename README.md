# Compiler Design
SJSU CS 153

## Assignment 4
#### Pascal Set definitions and variable declarations
Our task, if we choose to accept it, is to implement type definitions and declarations for Pascal sets. Also type checking of set operations.
* Set type declarations (named and unnamed types)
* Set declarations of a particular type
* Set operations and type checking thereof
* Modify the cross-reference table to include these type sets

Mak warned us that this assignment is challenging, so we should start soon.

WHOOOOOOO!

## Assignment 3
#### Pascal Sets
We gotta implement Pascal Sets in this here code provided by Ron Mak.
He gave us a (link)[http://www.tutorialspoint.com/pascal/pascal_sets.htm] to remind ourselves how sets work.

* Modify Pascal parser to build parse trees for set expressions.
* You will need to define new node types and design new tree structures to represent set values and set expressions.
* Modify the executor routines 
* Modify assignment statement parser classes
 
More magkic time! What we CS Students like to call: Codin'.

## Assignment 2
#### Java? Tokentizer
Gotta use the packages provided to make the
parser tokenize and specify the type of tokens
we are reading in from source.

WOOOOOO! Let's make some magic!
