Mak's Compiler Language Requirements
===================
* Must be procedure-oriented language
* Either existing language and/or subset OR invent a new one
* At the end of semester, must implement enough of lang to execute *nontrivial* program

### Suggested Implementatation of grammar and compiler
1. Expressions w/ numeric constants and scalar variables
2. Assignment statements
3. Control statements
4. Variable declarations (no type defs yet)
5. Procedure and function declarations
6. Procedure and function calls
7. Type definitions

## Tools we used (Besides git of course)
* [JavaCC](https://javacc.java.net/) to create frontend parser and to build parse trees.
* [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/)
