# Compiler Design
SJSU CS 153

## Assignment 3
#### Pascal Sets
We gotta implement Pascal Sets in this here code provided by Ron Mak.
He gave us a (link)[http://www.tutorialspoint.com/pascal/pascal_sets.htm] to remind ourselves how sets work.

* Modify Pascal parser to build parse trees for set expressions.
* You will need to define new node types and design new tree structures to represent set values and set expressions.
* Modify the executor routines 
* Modify assignment statement parser classes
 
More magkic time! What we CS Students like to call: Codin'.

## Assignment 2
#### Java? Tokentizer
Gotta use the packages provided to make the
parser tokenize and specify the type of tokens
we are reading in from source.

WOOOOOO! Let's make some magic!
